This repository is for problem specifications written in Essence.

It will not contain Essence' outputs, and etc.

It will instead optionally contain a README file per problem containing insights
and findings about the problem.

Optionally, it will also contain:

* parameter and solution files for known/published instances.
* scripts to generate random parameter files.
