This repository is for problem specifications written in Essence.

It will not contain Essence' outputs, and etc. For those, see the repository EssenceCatalog-models

It will optionally contain a README file per problem containing notes and findings about the problem.

Optionally, it will also contain:

* parameter and solution files for known/published instances.
* scripts to generate random parameter files.

# Relation to CSPLib

`CSPLib <http://www.csplib.org>`_ is a library of problems specified in natural language.
Its code is hosted at `GitHub <http://github.com/csplib/csplib>`_.

This repository uses CSPLib as a submodule.
We will try to make sure that

* all the Essence files hosted on CSPLib are included in the Essence Catalog, and
* if an Essence file is added to the Essence Catalog, it will be moved to CSPLib as soon as possible (when we have a natural language problem specification ready).
