This repository is for problem specifications written in Essence.

It will not contain Essence' outputs, and etc. For those, see the repository EssenceCatalog-models

It will optionally contain a README file per problem containing notes and findings about the problem.

Optionally, it will also contain:

* parameter and solution files for known/published instances.
* scripts to generate random parameter files.

Old Version
-----------

An older version of the Essence Catalog is referenced from `The Automated Modelling of Constraint Programs <http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/aig/constraints/AutoModel/>`_ webpage hosted at the University of York.
Unfortunately this version is not available at the moment.
We found a version of it on the `Wayback machine <http://web.archive.org/web/20150402222531/http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/aig/constraints/AutoModel/Essence/specs120/>`_ which can be used in case you need to refer to that version.

Relation to CSPLib
------------------

`CSPLib <http://www.csplib.org>`_ is a library of problems specified in natural language.
Its code is hosted at `GitHub <http://github.com/csplib/csplib>`_.

This repository uses CSPLib as a submodule.

We will try to make sure that:

* all the Essence files hosted on CSPLib are included in the Essence Catalog, and
* if an Essence file is added to the Essence Catalog, it will be moved to CSPLib as soon as possible (when we have a natural language problem specification ready).
